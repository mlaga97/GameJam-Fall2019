## Description
Your space pod crashed onto a tiny moon near a forest planet. While trying to reassemble the pod, you realize most of your parts are ruined. To make matters even worse, as soon as you notice your power core is still good, a hermit runs up and steals it. You see a robot in a trash pile nearby. Maybe he can help...
